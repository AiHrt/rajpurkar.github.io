Today I paint you a picture
With words that flow
From a mind with much to say
To a pen that is wise
In draining its run
Little by little.

Before night seeps into day
It whistles with the winds
Tunes of a land far away
Where these words are to follow
Carrying answers to questions
Sung in soprano.

And the spaghetti that makes one and one two
Tangles the mind
In curiosity and wonder
Of a canvas unpainted
But patient in its wait;
Two brushes by its side.
