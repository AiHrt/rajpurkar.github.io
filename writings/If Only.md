Vivacious, the laughs of the heart.
Memorable, the hugs before the part.
Alive, the adventure without a wheel.
Unfinished, our story, no wrap and no seal.

Sailed, the current against the call.
Failed, the words that just couldnâ€™t fall.
Strange, the feelings that missed their call to show.
Nervous, the heart that paced, no time to slow.

Forgotten, a flying spark can also flee.
Regret, a future we may never see.
Rewind, the rewrite I wish in time.
Gone, the story left unfinished, with a rhyme.
