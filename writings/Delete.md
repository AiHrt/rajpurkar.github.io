A perfectionist
Trying to fix a blemish in the past.
An introspector
Mulling over the details that rippled fast.
A patient
Trusting in time and space to heal the pain.
A repentant
Trying to take back the words in vain.

I'm no weightlifter
That can bench this shame away.
I'm no doctor,
All I can do is trust and pray.
I’m no singer
With a good theme song to play.
I’m no player,
About to forfeit this game today.

A clock
Ticking away the moments so fine.
A calculator,
Adding and multiplying wrinkle lines of mine.
A typewriter,
Etching my thoughts, my mistakes don't mind.
A keyboard,
Got an delete key, became a master of rewind.
