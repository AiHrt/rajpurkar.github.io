What is your flavor,
Tangy, zesty, or sweet?
What are you at your pith,
Beneath the veneer of your peel?

And does your peel betray the flavor inside,
What do I know about you, what do you hide?
Soft inside your callous shell,
Hardened after that time you fell?

If we took the time to ripen,
Shed away our coats with time,
What beauty would be left in our flesh?
Would we find that our flavors meshed?

Whatever our flavors,
Tangy, zesty or sweet.
Let us be that at our piths,
Or we may never get a chance to feel.
