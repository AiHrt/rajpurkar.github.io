title: The Waltz
start: Dec 2, 2015

Our hands clasp each other’s,
Soft smiles lighting up our faces.
Making conversation about our day
While our feet are in wait,
Tapping in anticipation for a count.

My back to the wall
And the waltz swings into motion,
Impatient feet relieved
To be dancing with the music
In sweet company.

And our feet in perfect harmony,
Flowing with each other’s movements,
A deceptive beauty hiding
The intricacy of the mechanics.

We may smile at each other
Quickly shy away from each other's gaze,
As we sail around the dance floor.
An unspoken link, hand in hand.
