In their dreams they meet again,
Caught in surprise at each otherâ€™s sight.
Their pounding chests forced to unlock
The pain that has been tucked away
Like a todo item never checked off.

They struggle to maintain their poise
As they make their way to each other,
Their eyelids brimming
With memories of what they once were.

From a brief exchange of pleasantries
To an impassioned exchange of honesties,
They've imagined all the words they never spoke,
All the time they never shared.

Not ones for goodbyes,
But never imagined the struggle to say hello.
Once the keepers of best secrets,
Now only silence in-between.

The beats of their hardened hearts
Perhaps still in synchrony.
Perhaps better left unchecked.
