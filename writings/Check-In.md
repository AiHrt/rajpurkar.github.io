title: Check-In
start: March 13, 2016

Once again the familiar scent
Of the airport coffee shop,
Facing my airplane out the window.

As my coffee fuels me,
The airplane sips its own drink.
A brief respite well deserved,
And much needed.

A strange familiarity in our meet,
At the end of another chapter
The threads of our existences intertwine
Again and again for these brief moments.

Airport fantasies of free upgrades,
Unfulfilled by curt turndowns,
But dreams to travel first-class
As alive as ever.

A nostalgic familiarity then,
In the hopes shared by a younger self.
A little more cooked, a little more baked
But the dough no different now.

I wonder then of a future self,
Who will have lived chapters
Yet unknown and unread.
Sipping coffee by the window
In contemplation, checked in.
