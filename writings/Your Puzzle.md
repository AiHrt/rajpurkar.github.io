title: Your Puzzle
start: May 31, 2016

A fear of the clumsy fall,
To be expended and come to a halt.
Started with a sprint,
To get a head start in this marathon.

Climbing towards the mountaintop,
Looked back. See yourself waving back
From where you once stood.
You've come far.

Progress, not change.
Not just through the mountains, but the valleys
Which pick you apart and jumble your pieces,
So that you can play your greatest puzzle.

It's not that you came unprepared,
It's that the twists and turns threw you off.
Solace in that you're not racing alone, Lightning McQueen!
You'll see that these turns were made for drifting.
