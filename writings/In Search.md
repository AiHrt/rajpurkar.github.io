In search for words that capture
Not what i wish to say
But what i wish to mean.

In embrace of vulnerability
Yet halted at the gates of a higher brain,
Once again in battle
With one that displays no reservations.

So how am I to answer
To the honesty
That permeates this code of words
With an open heart.

What am I afraid of?
Of being seen in a different light?
Or disappointing or being disappointed?
What do I have to lose
But my veneer?

At a loss for words:
My mind silent, but honest
To questions unanswered.

Walking towards each other
On a path of honest words,
Of unselfish smiles and meandering conversations,
In our openness,
I will meet you halfway.
