title:         Edusalsa
description:   A single class can transform a life. A popular introduction to programming class leads to the discovery of a passion for computer science, a social dance class exposes a deep appreciation for artistic expression--experiences like these are at the core of a Stanford education. Yet out of the 5000 classes offered here, students only have time to take less than 1% during their undergraduate career. This small selection of classes determines the foundation on which passions are developed - passions that lead to great innovations and great discoveries that change the world. Some students arrive at Stanford with clear visions of their futures. Others need a little time to explore and decide what to do with their lives. Edusalsa lets students find the classes where they can discover their passions, equipping them with new tools on their path of intellectual discovery, infusing life and vitality into the Stanford experience.
